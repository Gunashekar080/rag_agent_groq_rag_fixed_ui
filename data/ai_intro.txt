Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks
that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language,
recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.

Key concepts in AI include:
- Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that learn from data.
- Deep Learning: Neural networks with many layers.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding and generating human language.
- Computer Vision: Interpreting visual information from images or videos.
