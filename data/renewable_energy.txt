Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished,
such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

Benefits of renewable energy include:
1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.
2. Lower air pollution and improved public health.
3. Energy security through domestic energy production.
4. Long-term cost stability since fuel (sun, wind) is free.
5. Job creation in installation, maintenance, and manufacturing.
